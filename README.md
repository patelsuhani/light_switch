# Arduino LED Switch Control

This Arduino sketch controls three LEDs based on the state of a switch. When the switch is not pressed, a green LED is turned on. When the switch is pressed, a red LED blinks.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- 3 LEDs (1 green, 2 red)
- 1 momentary push-button switch
- Resistors for LEDs (optional, depending on the LEDs used)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
