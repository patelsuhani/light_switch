# Arduino LED Switch Control

This Arduino sketch controls three LEDs based on the state of a switch. When the switch is not pressed, a green LED is turned on. When the switch is pressed, a red LED blinks.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- 3 LEDs (1 green, 2 red)
- 1 momentary push-button switch
- Resistors for LEDs (optional, depending on the LEDs used)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Circuit Setup
- Connect the green LED to pin 3.
- Connect the two red LEDs to pins 4 and 5.
- Connect one end of the switch to pin 2 and the other end to GND.
- Add appropriate resistors in series with the LEDs to limit current if necessary.
